# ITX-Llama - Games Compatibility and Tips

This section will try to collect custom tips and tricks necessary for making your favorite games work on the ITX Llama. No platform is perfect and the MS-DOS/Win98 days were a wild west of hacks and incompatibilities. There is no single system that will ever run everything perfectly but if we've found a way to make it run on the Llama, it will be documented here. This is a work in progress and more games will be added.
