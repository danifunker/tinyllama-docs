# FreeDOS SD Card README
## Thank You for Your Support!

Dear Retro PC enthusiast,

Thank you for purchasing this SD card preloaded with FreeDOS, applications, games, and demos! Your support means the world to us, and we truly appreciate your passion for retro computing.

### About This SD Card

This card has been prepared as a convenience for our customers, providing a ready-to-use FreeDOS environment along with a selection of software. We’ve included various applications and games to enhance your experience, but due to the nature of FreeDOS, some titles may require additional configuration or troubleshooting to function properly.

## Important Notes

#### Software Compatibility

Not all applications and games have been thoroughly tested. Some may need tweaks to work correctly in FreeDOS.

#### Licensing and Copyright

We have made every effort to include only demos, shareware, and freeware to avoid copyright concerns. However, please ensure you comply with any relevant licensing agreements.

#### Customization Encouraged

If a program doesn’t run as expected, experimenting with settings such as memory management (HIMEM, EMM386), sound card configurations, or FreeDOS options may help resolve issues.

We sincerely appreciate your support and enthusiasm for classic computing. If you encounter any issues or have feedback, feel free to reach out to us. Happy computing!

**Best regards,** <br>
**The RetroDreams Team**
