# Meet the TinyLlama family

TinyLlamas are a family of retro inspired computers designed and built by [Eivind Bohler](https://github.com/eivindbohler). <br>
Each iteration is a variation built around the following principles:

- Build A fully-fledged 486/Pentium-class PC in a tiny form factor
- Integrate Sound Blaster Pro-compatible audio
- Add a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 for Roland MT-32 and General MIDI music
- Open-source the hardware schematics, board layout and BIOS - _build your own!_
- Excellent modern hardware for playing Retro DOS games!
